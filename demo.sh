echo "=== Analysis ==="
echo "Notice how:"
echo "- Abstract words (believe, knowledge, wisdom, that, many, etc.) are filtered out"
echo "- Concrete visual concepts (colors, objects, people, actions, emotions) are preserved"  
echo "- The result is a simplified pidgin focusing on observable, physical reality"
echo "- Grammar is minimal but functional: Subject-Verb-Object with visual modifiers"
